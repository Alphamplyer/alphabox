# alphabox

A new Flutter project to develop an app with all the tool that I found usefull in everyday life

## TODO & BUGS:
- Can't change the theme mode, it's always the system's one.
- In light mod, everything is dark, need to change that... umh
- On mobile, filters take all the place, hide them !
- On desktop and tablets (large side), filters button are too large, contraints growing.
